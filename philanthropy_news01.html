            <mark>KELLOGG DELIVERS BETTER DAYS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC</mark>
            
              <p>Ensuring the health & safety of our employees while supporting people in need around the world</p>
              <p>As the number of people impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) increases worldwide, Kellogg is demonstrating more compassion than ever by working to support its employees and 
                neighbors in need.</p>
              <p>As always, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority and we are ensuring they are supported, especially during these challenging times. People who can work from home are 
                doing so. For those on the front-lines in stores or producing foods to help meet the unprecedented needs of families around the world, we’ve significantly enhanced our already robust 
                sanitation protocols, and implemented strict social distancing and wellness checks. In recognition of their efforts, we also have enhanced benefits for front-line employees including extended 
                ill time, “thank-you” bonuses and child-care alternatives, so they can care for themselves and their families. We’ve expanded our workforce in some places due to increased demand and to 
                ensure our hard-working employees also have time to rest and recharge, away from work. Of course, these steps are above and beyond what we do every day to put our people first.</p>
              <p>According to new research from the United Nations University, the fallout from COVID-19 could push half a billion people into poverty in developing countries, significantly increasing their risk 
                of food insecurity. In response, Kellogg and its charitable funds have donated $18 million in food and funds to global COVID-19 hunger relief efforts to date and that number is growing. In 
                total, our contributions are aiding the following organizations around the world: The Global FoodBanking Network, supporting food banks across Asia, Europe and Latin America; European 
                Food Banks Federation, supporting food banks across Europe; Feeding America, supporting 200 food bank locations across the United States and Food Banks Canada, supporting 500 food 
                banks across Canada.</p>
              <p><q>Whenever disasters and crises strike, Kellogg provides comfort and important nourishment when people need it most,</q> said Kris Bahner, Senior Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs. <q>With 
                school and business closures, transportation shutdowns and ’shelter-at-home‘ mandates, our contributions support the essential work of our food bank partners on the front-lines, helping 
                those who may not know where their next meal is coming from.</q></p>

            <div class="newsDetailList">
                <strong>Our employees worldwide also are showing tremendous generosity during this unprecedented time. For example:</strong>  
                <ul>                    
                    <li>In the United Kingdom, the team is donating 500,000 servings of food to the National Health Service (NHS) and key workers, in addition to distributing 3 million servings of food to charity 
                        partners across its four nations.</li>
                    <li>Anthony Holme, our South Africa general manager, launched a personal challenge to raise funds for a local school feeding program. The team also is donating noodles and snacks that 
                        provide nearly 440,000 meals to local organizations.</li>
                    <li>In the United States, the Kashi® team donated two pallets of food to local family services in Solano Beach, California. In our Battle Creek, Michigan hometown, we donated truckloads of 
                        food to support the local food bank. Additionally, employees at our food production facilities in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Omaha, Nebraska and Jackson, Tennessee 
                        are making regular food donations to local organizations.</li>
                    <li>To thank local health care workers, employees at our food production facilities in Valls, Spain donated cereal and snacks to a hospital and senior care center.</li>
                    <li>In South Korea, the team is providing much-needed cereal to children in child care centers.</li>
                    <li>In Latin America, the team is distributing cash and food donations to communities across the region, including those in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Brazil.</li>
                    <li>In Canada, the team quickly advanced planned food donations to provide immediate relief to communities with the greatest need</li>
                </ul>
            </div> 

            <p>Our U.S. team created a special commercial to share our appreciation for the front-line employees, farmers, truckers, grocery stockers and cashiers, food bank workers, and everyone else 
                around the world working so hard to bring food to the table during these unprecedented times. And on May 5, Kellogg’s Frosted Mini-Wheats®, Special K, Frosted Flakes®, Rice Krispies, 
                Eggo® and Nutri-Grain® teamed up with No Kid Hungry for #GivingTuesdayNow to provide immediate hunger relief to those impacted by COVID-19.  That day, the brands matched every 
                donation pledged to No Kid Hungry, up to $200,000. In just 24 hours, Kellogg helped raise $670,000 (and counting)!</p>
            <p><q>We applaud the consumers and our customers who are generously helping as well</q>, Kris said. <q>Our partners tell us that every bit of support is truly appreciated by those most impacted by the 
                pandemic.</q></p>
            <p>Kellogg received this heartfelt message from one of its U.S.-based food bank partners, but it could have come from anywhere in the world. That’s because every Kellogg region is helping to 
                feed those in need and committed to making an impact in the lives of our neighbors facing hunger.</p>
            <p><q>Despite the incredible obstacles that life is sending to all of us, it is extremely touching to see how humanity is capable of the best during this crisis.</q></p>
            <p>Our global COVID-19 hunger relief efforts are part of our Kellogg’s® Better Days global</p>
